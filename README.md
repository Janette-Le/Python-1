All we acknowledge, at the end of January 2020, Britain officially exited Europe. Thousands of politicians, economists and socialist forecasted that this event will create a huge affect (positive or negative) on the social, labor force and economic fields for both sides Britain and Europe.
There are many factors that affect the unemployment rate; in macroscope, it may be the volatility of the economy or the intervention/salvage of the government; in microscope, it may depend on age, gender, education level of the employee and local regional economy. In this capstone, I will determine the unemployment trend of UK over the last 15 years as well as which and how demographic elements have affected unemployment in the UK over the last 15 years.

This project is my personal final work for my Python class. As requests by my professor, he asked everyone to look for a raw dataset that is not available on Kaggle's, so I picked a dataset on data.gov.uk to execute my assignment. To prevent me from manually cleansing data columns by columns, I defined some functions in the Module file. These functions are alternative ways to save time when cleaning raw datasets, as well as sharpen algorithm logical sense. All directions and details are officially expressed on Report, while executing code is in .ipynb file. For visualization supports, you can open my presentation on Slide file to have a more comprehensive view about my work.
