# UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS BY ETHNICITY, GENDER AND REGIONS IN THE UK FROM 2004 TO 2018
This project is my personal final work for my Python class. As requests by my professor, he asked everyone to look for a raw dataset that is not available on Kaggle's, so I picked a dataset on data.gov.uk to execute my assignment. To prevent me from manually cleansing data columns by columns, I defined some functions in the Module file. These functions are alternative ways to save time when cleaning raw datasets, as well as sharpen algorithm logical sense. All directions and details are officially expressed on Report, while executing code is in .ipynb file. For visualization supports, you can open my presentation on Slide file to have a more comprehensive view about my work.
